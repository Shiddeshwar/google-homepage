Goal was to replicate the google homepage. 
Accomplished the goal with moderate success. 
The final result looks pretty identical compared to a Desktop as a viewport Homepage.
But still severly lacks when comes to responsiveness and looks awful in smaller viewports.

Did this as a part of The Odin Project mini project.
